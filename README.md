# IP.APP API

A free and easy way to request your current IP address. Without any ads, trackers, or weird requirements.

In addition to the `plain/text` response, this API also supports getting the IP address in [JSON](#json) format and in the
[HTTP Headers](https://http.dev/headers?utm_source=ip.app) responses (e.g. using the [HEAD](https://http.dev/head?utm_source=ip.app) method).

## Usage

The API supports the following [HTTP methods](https://http.dev/methods?utm_source=ip.app):
- [GET](https://http.dev/get?utm_source=ip.app)
- [POST](https://http.dev/post?utm_source=ip.app)
- [HEAD](https://http.dev/head?utm_source=ip.app)

The following [cURL](https://curl.se) and [Python](https://python.org) (using the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io) library) examples will return the IP address:

> Note: Since cURL does not need the URL to include the scheme, just using `ip.app` will work on most machines. However, if it doesn't, just add `https://` to the address.

### GET

Returns `plain text` or [JSON](#json) in HTTP response body.

#### cURL

```bash
curl ip.app
```

#### Python

```python
requests.get('https://ip.app').text.strip()
```

### POST

Returns `plain text` or [JSON](#json) in HTTP response body. Any [POST](https://http.dev/post?utm_source=ip.app) data submitted is ignored and disregarded.

#### cURL

```bash
curl -X POST ip.app
```

#### Python

```python
requests.post('https://ip.app').text.strip()
```

### HEAD

No HTTP response body is returned, only [HTTP headers](https://http.dev/headers?utm_source=ip.app) are returned.

#### cURL

```bash
curl -sI ip.app | grep -i "x-request-ip" | cut -d' ' -f2
```

#### Python

```python
requests.head('https://ip.app').headers.get('X-Request-IP', 'Unknown')
```

## JSON

The API returns a JSON response when using query parameters `?format=json` or `?json=1`. For example:

```bash
https://ip.app?format=json
https://ip.app?json=1
```

The API also returns a JSON response when the [Accept](https://http.dev/accept?utm_source=ip.app) header contains either one of the following values:

```bash
application/json
*/json
```

The HTTP response body will be like:

```json
{
  "ip": "1.1.1.1",
}
```

### JSON Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `ip` | String | The public IP address of the requesting client (IPv4 or IPv6), or `Unknown` when no IP address is detected | `1.1.1.1`, `2001:db8::1`, `Unknown` |

### JSON examples

Try the following examples:

#### cURL

Using the query parameter `?format=json`:

```bash
curl -s https://ip.app?format=json | grep -o '"ip":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4
```

Using the `Accept` header:

```bash
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" https://ip.app | grep -o '"ip":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4
```


#### Python

Using the query parameter `?json=1`:

```python
requests.get('https://ip.app?json=1').json().get('ip', 'Unknown')
```

Using the `Accept` header:

```python
requests.get('https://ip.app', headers={'Accept': 'application/json'}).json().get('ip', 'Unknown')
```

## X-Request-IP HTTP Header

The API returns with every HTTP request a `X-Request-IP` HTTP header, which includes the public IP address of the requesting client (IPv4 or IPv6), or `Unknown` when no IP address is detected.

Since the IP address is included in the [HTTP header](https://http.dev/headers?utm_source=ip.app), response, it can be efficiently retrieved using just a [HEAD](https://http.dev/head?utm_source=ip.app) request without needing to download the response body. This makes it particularly useful for applications that want to avoid the overhead of initiating a [GET](https://http.dev/get?utm_source=ip.app) request and downloading and reading the HTTP response body.

For examples, check out the [HEAD](#head) examples under [Usage](#usage).

## Response Values

The API returns one of the following response values across all formats (`plain text`, [JSON](#json), and [HTTP header](#x-request-ip-http-header)):

- **IP Address**: The detected public IP address in IPv4 format (e.g., `1.1.1.1`) or IPv6 format (e.g., `2001:db8::1`)
- **Unknown**: Returned as a fallback when no IP address is detected

## Status Codes

The API returns the following [HTTP status codes](https://http.dev/status?utm_source=ip.app):

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `200` | Successful request - IP address returned |
| `301` | Redirect to documentation |
| `404` | Not found - invalid endpoint |
| `429` | Too many requests - rate limiting applied |
| `1015` | Rate limiting - requests blocked due to rate limits |

## Accepted Paths

The API accepts requests to the following paths:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/` | Main endpoint - returns IP address |
| `/docs` | Redirects to the API documentation |
| `/robots.txt` | Robots exclusion file, based on [robotstxt.com/ai](https://robotstxt.com/ai?utm_source=ip.app) |
| `/favicon.ico` | Favicon icon |

All other paths return a [404 status code](https://http.dev/404?utm_source=ip.app).


## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is enabled to ensure fair usage of the API. Requests exceeding the rate limit will receive a `429` or `1015` status code response.

## Geographic Restrictions

Certain countries are blocked from using this API due to historic abuse patterns. Users from these countries will not be able to access the service.

# IP.APP API

An easy way to request the current IP address and without any ads, trackers, or weird requirements.

In addition to the `plain/text` response, this API also supports getting the IP address in a JSON and 
[HTTP Headers](https://http.dev/headers?utm_source=ip.app) responses (e.g. using the [HEAD](https://http.dev/head?utm_source=ip.app) method).

## JSON

The API returns a JSON response when using query parameters `?format=json` or `?json=1`. For example:

```bash
https://ip.app/?format=json
https://ip.app/?json=1
```

The API also returns a JSON response when the [Accept](https://http.dev/accept?utm_source=ip.app) header contains either one of the following:

```bash 
application/json
*/json
```

The HTTP response body will be like:

```json
{
  "ip": "1.1.1.1",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-28T09:43:30.269Z"
}
```

#### IP API Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `ip` | String | The public IP address of the requesting client | `"1.1.1.1"` |
| `timestamp` | String | ISO 8601 formatted timestamp indicating when the request was processed by the server | `"2025-06-28T09:43:30.269Z"` |

## X-Your-IP HTTP Header

The API returns with every HTTP request a `X-Your-IP` HTTP header, which includes the public IP address of the requesting client.

The API supports the following [HTTP methods](https://http.dev/methods?utm_source=ip.app):
- [GET](https://http.dev/get?utm_source=ip.app)
- [POST](https://http.dev/post?utm_source=ip.app) - Any POST data submitted is ignored and disregarded.
- [HEAD](https://http.dev/head?utm_source=ip.app)

The following [cURL](https://curl.se?utm_source=ip.app) examples will return the IP address:

### HEAD

```bash
curl -sI ip.app | grep -i "x-your-ip" | cut -d' ' -f2
```

### GET

```bash
curl ip.app
```

### POST

```bash
curl -X POST ip.app
```

*Note: Since cURL does not need the URL to include the scheme, just using `ip.app` will work on most machines. However, if it doesn't, just add 
`http://` to the address.*

This API is inspired by [icanhazip](http://icanhazip.com), which operates in a similar way but does not support IP reporting in a HEAD or JSON response.
